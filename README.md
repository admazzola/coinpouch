# Coinpouch

A NodeJS light Ethereum wallet for the linux terminal.  Zeta is free and open-source software that allows developers to store and spend money directly in their terminal/server to pay for other software libraries and services using an API.  


## TODO

Build a JSON-RPC listener
Allow for generation of a new eth address and link into INFURA (like metamask) to grab balances and more
Allow for registering services and setting payment caps (?)


## Implementing basic web3 functions (like metamask)
--see app/scripts/config.js in metamask repo
